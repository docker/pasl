//! A persistent mapping between key triples and key IDs

//! This module declares a `ManageKeyIDs` trait to help providers to store in a persistent manner
//! the mapping between the name and the IDs of the keys they manage. Different implementors might
//! store this mapping using different means but it has to be persistent.
