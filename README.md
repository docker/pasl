**Parsec** is the **P**latform **A**bst**R**action for **SEC**urity, a new open-source initiative
to provide a common API to secure services in a platform-agnostic way.

Read the Parsec documentation [online](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/)!

## Disclaimer

Parsec is a new open source project and is under development. This code repository is being made
available so that the developer community can learn and give feedback about the new interfaces and the concepts of platform-agnostic security.
The implementation that is provided is suitable for exploratory testing and experimentation only.
This test implementation does not offer any tangible security benefits and therefore is not
suitable for use in production. Documentation pages may be incomplete and are subject to change
without notice. Interfaces may change in such a way as to break compatibility with client code.
Contributions from the developer community are welcome. Please refer to the contribution guidelines.

## Example

Launch the Parsec service with Mbed Crypto as the only provider (using the default configuration):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec.git
$ cd parsec
$ RUST_LOG=info cargo run
```

Parsec Client Libraries can now communicate with the service. For example using the Rust Test client,
RSA signatures can be done as follows:
```rust
use parsec_client_test::TestClient;

let mut client = TestClient::new();
let key_name = String::from("ðŸ”‘ What shall I sign? ðŸ”‘");
client.create_rsa_sign_key(key_name.clone()).unwrap();
let signature = client.sign(key_name,
                            String::from("Platform AbstRaction for SECurity").into_bytes())
                      .unwrap();
```
